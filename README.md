# Newton-s-Cradle
You are a scientist investigating the behaviour of pendulums and how they transfer energy. You have been tasked to create a simulation for a sequence of five pendulums just touching each other. The pendulum can be moved by the mouse. Create the simulation and observe how the pendulum balls interact with each other.
